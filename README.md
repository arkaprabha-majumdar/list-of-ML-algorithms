# List-of-ML-algorithms
This is a list of ML algorithms that are classifies into 4 broad categories. Updated frequently.
The four cateegories are:
<ul>
  <li>Supervised learning</li>
  <li>Unsupervised learning</li>
  <li>Semi-supervised learning</li>
  <li>Reinforcement learning</li>
</ul>

# Supervised learning
Decision Trees
Naive Bayes Classification
Support vector machines for classification problems
Random forest for classification and regression problems
Linear regression for regression problems
Ordinary Least Squares Regression
Logistic Regression
Ensemble Methods

# Unsupervised learning
K-means for clustering problems
Apriori algorithm for association rule learning problems
Principal Component Analysis
Singular Value Decomposition
Independent Component Analysis
Novelty detection
Deep learning or deep belief networks.
Bayesian graphical models
Correspondence Analysis
Multidimensional scaling
PLS (partial least squares)
Agglomerative clustering

# Semi-supervised learning
Generative models (GANs)
Low-density separation
Graph-based methods (manifold learning)
Heuristic approaches (using different models to train on different (ideally disjoint) sets of features and generate labeled examples for one another.)

# Reinforcement learning
Q-learning
SARSA
Deep Q-network
